Small project made for esmovia erasmus trip to Valencia, Spain.

Goal of a project was to show places that we visited during our stay, mention pros and cons, price, localisation and our rating. You can add places to your profile by liking them.

Project was made with Laravel 11 on backend and React on frontend to maintain it as Single Page Application.

To run it you will need database set up on localhost with port 3307 (you can migrate tables using ´php artisan migrate´), then run backend in ´project_plaza/´ with ´php artisan serve´, then frontend in ´project_plaza/public/plaza/´ using ´npm run dev´
